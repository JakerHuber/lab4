# Lab 4
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 361 Fall 2018 

In this lab you must create a valid html page with an HTML form on it that submits its data to the provided processing script. This form should gather the same info as the provided PDF sample of an existing paper form.

## Requirements

Use the following controls in your form:  
- [x] Single line text fields
- [x] Multi line text area
- [x] Drop Down Menu
- [x] Radio Buttons
- [x] Checkboxes
- [x] Hidden field
- [x] Proper label tags on all the controls
- [x] Use the fieldset & legend on the form surrounding some controls where appropriate

## Instructions
```
Save your document as to a github repository and link it to the BaseCamp Production Problems. 
 
Points will be deducted for invalid markup, missing requirements, a form that does not post data to the script in the proper areas, broken forms, and not following instructions. 
 
Everything you need to do this lab was demonstrated in our forms lecture. Review the lecture video again if you have problems. 
 
You need to fully test the form and make sure it submits all the data properly before you upload it to blackboard. You will know if the form works properly if you see the results page and all the data you entered is correct. If I press submit and get an error you can expect a very poor grade. 
 
CSS styling of the forms is not required. Try to structure the form with proper html and let the browser format with its default styling. Try to recreate the supplied PDF paper form as an html form.
